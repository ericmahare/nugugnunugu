Easter concludes a religious time of sacrifice, called Lent.<\/p><p>Lent is 40 days of fasting and prayer. Holy Week comes at the end of Lent, and it includes several important days. Holy Thursday celebrates Jesus\u2019 Last Supper with His disciples. Good Friday is the following day, and it commemorates the day Jesus was crucified.<\/p><p>Christians believe that three days after Jesus died on the cross, He was resurrected and rose from the grave. The resurrection day is celebrated on Easter Sunday. The holiday serves as a time of remembrance and celebration with Family-Friendly Easter Getaways.<\/p><p><strong><em>When Is It Celebrated?<\/em><\/strong><\/p><p>Easter is celebrated on a Sunday each year. The date can fall anywhere between March 22 and April 25. The celebration date is based on the lunar calendar and does not fall on the same calendar day each year.4 Several proposals were introduced to find a specific date for Easter, but church and denominational leaders could not conclude.<\/p><p><strong><em>Why Is It Celebrated?<\/em><\/strong><\/p><p>The holiday is designed to celebrate the fact that Jesus rose from the dead after being arrested and then crucified on the cross.<\/p><p>In the Bible, the New Testament states that Jesus called himself the Son of God and was arrested by Roman authorities for making the claim. He was then sentenced to death by Pontius Pilate, a Roman leader. However, following his death on the cross, the Bible states that Jesus rose from the dead. Easter commemorates Jesus&#8217;s return to life.<\/p><p>Super Eagles Travel and Tours is delighted to provide you with these affordable Family-Friendly Easter Getaways Easter tour packages:<\/p><ol class=\"wp-block-list\"><li><strong>Burudani Adventure Park<\/strong><\/li><\/ol><p>DATE: 30<sup>th<\/sup> March 2024<\/p><p>RATE PER PERSON: KSH 4,000<\/p><p>Our package includes:<\/p><p>-Return transport to and from Nairobi City Centre<\/p><p>-Team building activities by a professional facilitator<\/p><p>-High Rope\/Zip lining\/Sky Cycling\/Giant Swing\/Archery\/Amazing quest<\/p><p>-Buffet Lunch with a soft drink<\/p><p>-Mineral Water<\/p><ol start=\"2\" class=\"wp-block-list\"><li><strong>Tanzania<\/strong><\/li><\/ol><p>3DAYS\/2NIGHTS SUPER EXCITING ADVENTURE IN TANZANIA!<\/p><p>30th March \u20131st April 2024<\/p><p>Day One: Departure<\/p><p>&#8211; Departure from Nairobi to Lake Manyara to Tanzania via the Namanga border.<\/p><p>&#8211; Accommodation at Twiga Lodge -Dinner<\/p><p>DAY 2: Excursion at Lake Manyara<\/p><p>&#8211; Visit Lake Manyara National Park at Mto wa Mbu<\/p><p>&#8211; Lunch and proceed to Arusha Town<\/p><p>&#8211; Accommodation in Arusha at Charity Hotel (Bed and breakfast)<\/p><p>Day 3: Tanzania to Nairobi<\/p><p>&#8211; Early Breakfast at the Hotel in Arusha<\/p><p>&#8211; Visit Kikuletwa waterfalls for the famous foot massage<\/p><p>&#8211; Visit cultural centers \/Museum<\/p><p>&#8211; Have lunch and proceed to Nairobi Via Namanga Border<\/p><p>COST:<\/p><p>Rate per person: KSH 35,600<\/p><p>TOTAL COST: KSH 712,000<\/p><p>What is Included:<\/p><p>&#8211; Transport via Overland Truck<\/p><p>&#8211; Accommodation and Meals on a full board basis at Twiga Lodge and Charity Hotel<\/p><p>&#8211; 3-Meals a Day &amp; Drinking water<\/p><p>&#8211; Entrance fee at Lake Manyara for a game drive&nbsp;<\/p><ol start=\"3\" class=\"wp-block-list\"><li><strong>Dubai<\/strong><\/li><\/ol><p>Package: 5 days &amp; 4 nights<\/p><p>Inclusions:&nbsp;<\/p><p>&#8211; 4 nights stay in premium hotels in Dubai<\/p><p>&#8211; Return private transfer from Dubai Int.
